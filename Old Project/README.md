Introduction
============

This is a small summer project of two 19 year old informatic's students.
The purpose of this project is to create a windows application that can 
calculate three different colour averages of you monitor:
the left side, middle and right sight. This information will then be used
to set 3 or more Philips Hue lights to those colours creating a "Ambi"
like effect for a windows PC. If this project works out we might support more operating systems.
